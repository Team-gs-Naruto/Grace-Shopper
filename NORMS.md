// For blocking bugs/issues we ask blocked teammate for help. Teammate that is not blocked can continue work. If no teammates are blocked but 1 teammate still needs help, other mates can lend a helping hand.
// If we disagree we can make a pros/cons list and vote after weighing 
// When member(s) is/are frustrated they need to communicate and team will be there to help/resolve any issues
// All team members need to verify code before merging
// Ask for help from fellows or instructor after max of 1 hour of team resolutions
// In pair, switch positions with partner if teammate gets stuck on their part for too long
// Evening huddles to discuss each person's contributions before the start of next class
// Morning huddles on weekdays at 9AM 
// Weekends free form convos throughout the day (planning for contributions done Friday night)
